# Binary Search Tree

# If a tree is a binary search tree, then traversing the tree in order should lead to sorted order of the values in the tree. 
# So, we can perform an in order traversal and check whether the node values are sorted or not.

# Another classic solution is to keep track of the minimum and maximum values a node can take. 
# And at each node we will check whether its value is between the min and max values itâ€™s allowed to take. 
# The root can take any value between negative infinity and positive infinity. At any node, its left child should be smaller than or equal than its own value, and similarly the right child should be larger than or equal to. 
# So during recursion, we send the current value as the new max to our left child and send the min as it is without changing. 
# And to the right child, we send the current value as the new min and send the max without changing.
